Hello! I'm Zachary Eanes and I'm currently a student at Western Carolina University.
I'm studying computer science as well as mathematics with a focus of data sciences. 

This is the account I use to upload and collaborate with partners for CS projects, 
assignments, and other programming things I've worked on. 

The languages that I currently know:
  - Java
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - C
  - MIPS (assembly)

I have also worked with HTML, CSS, and the Django framework, working some in front end development.
